# Machine-Learning-using-Python-SKLearn
 I have completed a 7-Days Bootcamp on Machine Learning and Python using libraries such as Numpy, Sklearn and Pandas and made a Linear Regression mini project.
 This project contains a dataset that describes the functionality of houses. On the basis of given features, I have to predict the house price.
The project helps to enhance my knowledge about python libraries and their uses. It includes some python libraries like:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
